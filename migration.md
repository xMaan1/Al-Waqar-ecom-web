# Laravel E-commerce Migration


This guide outlines the steps to migrate your Django e-commerce project to Laravel. Since your hosting provider only supports PHP/Laravel, this migration is necessary to deploy your application.


## Setup Steps
1. Install PHP 8.1+
2. Install Composer
3. Create Laravel project: composer create-project laravel/laravel .
4. Configure database in .env file


## Models
Create Laravel Eloquent models corresponding to Django models:
- Banner, Category, Brand, Color, Size, Product, ProductAttribute, ProductGallery, CartOrder, CartOrderItems, ProductReview, UserAddressBook


## Controllers
Create the following Laravel controllers:
- HomeController, ProductController, CartController, CheckoutController, UserController, AdminController


## Views
Convert Django templates to Laravel Blade templates:
- Main templates: index, product_list, product_detail, cart, checkout, etc.
- Authentication templates: login, register, profile, etc.
- Admin templates: dashboard, product management, etc.


## Routes
Define all routes in routes/web.php:
- Home, Product, Cart, Checkout routes
- Authentication routes
- Admin routes


## Database Migrations
Create migration files for all models:
- Run: php artisan make:migration for each model
- Configure table columns based on Django models
- Run migrations: php artisan migrate


## Final Steps
1. Move assets to public directory
2. Update file paths in views
3. Test all features
4. Deploy to production host


## Frontend Preservation
Since the frontend design and UI should remain unchanged:
1. Carefully convert Django template syntax to Blade syntax
2. Maintain all CSS and JavaScript files
3. Keep the same HTML structure and class names
4. Preserve all assets (images, fonts, etc.)
